ABOUT THIS GAME:

ORIGINAL AMIGA GAME DEVELOPED BY ROBERT
AKERBERG. MUSIC BY RICHARD BAYLISS.
DEVELOPED FOR THE C64 BY MAIK MERTEN.

HOW TO PLAY:

PLAYERS PLACE ATOMS IN TURNS. EACH
FIELD EXPLODES WHEN REACHING A CERTAIN
NUMBER OF ATOMS.

CORNERS: 2 ATOMS
  EDGES: 3 ATOMS
  OTHER: 4 ATOMS

UPON EXPLOSION FIELDS DISTRIBUTE ATOMS
INTO NEIGHBOURING FIELDS, WHICH ARE NOW
OWNED BY THE OWNER OF THE EXPLODING
FIELD. IF NEWLY AQUIRED FIELDS REACH
THEIR THRESHOLD, THEY IN TURN EXPLODE,
POSSIBLY CAUSING A CHAIN REACTION.

A PLAYER WINS IF NO FIELDS ARE LEFT TO
THE OTHER PLAYER.
