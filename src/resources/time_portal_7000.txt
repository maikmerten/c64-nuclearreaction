time_portal_7000.sid is a version of Richard Bayliss' Time_Portal.sid relocated
to 0x7000 for memory management reasons. This tune is used with permission
by Richard Bayliss. It can be distributed freely, but is not subject to the
GPL and does not become part of the compiled binary, being loaded from disk
on startup instead.
